## 🔥 Introduction

**NINDIA AI** is an autonomous AI bot created in India using **NVIDIA**‑grade GPU technologies that:

- automates the routine work of typical outsourcing teams (code, research, reports);
- understands the crypto market, SOL / SOLANA, DeFi and NFT;
- analyzes blockchain data in real time;
- can integrate with Smart contracts and trading tools.

The goal is to turn **$NINDIA** into one of the top AIs on the AI‑bot market and keep developing the project further.

> ⚠️ The project is built using the NVIDIA technology stack and Indian IT culture. Officially registered in the NVIDIA system.

## 💡 About the project

**NINDIA** is a technological experiment on SOLANA where:

- **NINDIA AI** acts as a digital “outsourcer” from India that takes over:
  - writing and reviewing code;
  - generating documentation;
  - finding bugs;
  - basic crypto research and analytics;
- the focus is on automating typical tasks that used to be delegated to Indian outsourcing teams;
- all of this is tied to the token economy of **$NINDIA** and open blockchain integrations.

This repository contains the source code of the **NINDIA AI** landing page: a promo page for investors, the community and early bot users.
