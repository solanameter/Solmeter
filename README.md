## 🚀 About the project

**Solmeter** is a web application for traders and crypto researchers that allows you to:

- quickly assess the current state and prospects of a token on the **SOLANA** blockchain;
- get an **AI‑powered forecast** of potential growth/decline;
- see a short analytical breakdown for a selected **Smart contract**.

You only need to paste the contract address of a Solana token (SPL token), and **Solmeter AI** will automatically:

- collect key metrics;
- build a model of the probable token movement;
- generate a human‑readable text summary.

Solmeter is designed as a fast market “thermometer”: instead of lengthy manual analysis, you get a concise yet informative forecast for any asset you’re interested in — from new meme coins to promising instruments in the SOL ecosystem.

## 🧠 Solmeter AI

**Solmeter AI** is the intelligent core of Solmeter that:

- works with crypto data related to the SOLANA **blockchain**;
- takes into account price behavior, on‑chain activity, and market context;
- generates a **forecast** (tendency to grow / fall / move sideways);
- produces a **short textual analysis** of the token.

Examples of what Solmeter AI does:

- Evaluates whether a token looks overheated or undervalued.
- Highlights sharp spikes/drops in interest.
- Provides an approximate summary of risks and possible scenarios.

> The goal of Solmeter AI is not to predict the future with 100% accuracy, but to **speed up your own analysis**, give a “second opinion,” and highlight important signals for $Solmeter‑like assets on SOL.

## ⚙️ How it works

1. **Choose a token**
   - Copy the token’s **Smart contract** address on SOLANA.
   - Paste it into the input field in the Solmeter interface.

2. **Data collection**
   - The service fetches data about the token and its activity in the SOL network.
   - On‑chain metrics and market parameters are processed.

3. **Solmeter AI processing**
   - Solmeter AI analyzes the aggregated data.
   - Produces a numerical estimate and a textual summary.

4. **Displaying the result**
   - On the screen you see:
     - a short forecast (growth / decline / uncertainty);
     - key signals and comments;
     - additional information about the token (where possible).

## ❓ FAQ

### What is Solmeter?

**Solmeter** is an analytical tool for tokens on the **SOLANA** blockchain that, with the help of **Solmeter AI**, provides a quick forecast of their behavior and a short analysis.  
It is based on public **blockchain** data and machine learning algorithms.

---

### Is this financial advice?

No.  
**Solmeter** and **Solmeter AI** are not financial advice and do not guarantee any result.  
They are auxiliary tools for your own research. Always do your own research (DYOR) and make decisions according to your risk profile.

---

### What data does Solmeter AI use?

**Solmeter AI** works with data related to:

- the **SOLANA (SOL)** blockchain;
- token price/action dynamics;
- basic contract characteristics.

The exact set of metrics may change and expand over time.

---

### How accurate are the forecasts?

Any forecast for the cryptocurrency market is probabilistic.  
**Solmeter AI** helps you:

- assess the token’s situation faster;
- highlight potential risks;
- get guidance on the current state.

But the decisions to buy/sell are yours alone.

---

### Will other blockchains besides SOLANA be supported?

At the moment, the focus of **Solmeter** is the **SOL / SOLANA** ecosystem.  
In the future, support for other networks is possible if users demand it.

---

## 🔐 Security & Disclaimer

- **Solmeter** works with public **blockchain** data.
- Never and under no circumstances **enter your private keys or seed phrases** — neither in Solmeter nor in any other web application.
- Use **Solmeter** as an auxiliary token analysis tool, not as your only source of truth.
- The cryptocurrency market is highly risky. You are fully responsible for your own decisions.
